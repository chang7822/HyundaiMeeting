- If I talk about the database or you decide that you need to check the database, you can immediately try to access the Hyundai Meeting database of Supabase through the Model Context Protocol. You don't have to ask me about the database.



- You can understand the entire project tree structure for all project questions and look into the content. You don't have to ask me for a specific code, you can check it right away and take action on the problem.
